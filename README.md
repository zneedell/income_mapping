# Boston Metro Housing Mapping

Here is the code used to generate the maps and plots available at https://zneedell.github.io/income_mapping/. The (messy and undocumented) Matlab code used to clean and organise the American Community Survey data is in the aff folder, as well as the raw csv downloads from American Fact Finder. The tiger shapefiles can be generated by running <code>make build/tract2.json</code>.
